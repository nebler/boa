This is a project original based on the Kaleidscope tutorial.
Additionally I have done the following:
Refactorings:
- Moved the lexer/parser to it's own folder


Featues:
- Added the option to read flags/input when starting the code
- Files can now be used as input
- CLI mode is still available just not default anymore (-i flag when starting)
